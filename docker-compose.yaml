# Your Volumes Configuration
# yaml
# Copy
# Edit
# volumes:
#   - mysql:/var/lib/mysql
# This line does the following:

# Defines a named volume (mysql)

# mysql is a named volume managed by Docker.
# It is used to persist database data.
# Mounts the volume to a specific directory (/var/lib/mysql) inside the container

# /var/lib/mysql is the default location where MySQL stores its database files.
# By mapping this directory to the named volume mysql, all MySQL data will be stored outside the container.
# This means the data is not lost if the container stops, crashes, or is removed.
